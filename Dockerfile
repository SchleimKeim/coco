# --- base packages ---
# AlmaLinux 10 (RHEL 10) dropped dnf modularity for its own AppStream
# packages ("No matching Modules to list") -- nodejs is now a single plain
# package (currently 22.x), no `dnf module enable` needed or available.
#
# python3.14: installed alongside the system python3 (3.12), not in place
# of it. /usr/bin/python3 is RPM-owned and dnf's own shebang is
# `#!/usr/bin/python3` -- repointing that symlink would run dnf under an
# interpreter its compiled C-extension modules (python3-libdnf5 etc.)
# aren't built against, breaking dnf itself. python3.14 gets made the
# *user-facing* default instead, via /usr/local/bin symlinks that win on
# PATH ahead of /usr/bin without touching the system binary (see below).

ARG HOME=/home/coco
# home dir is set to the host's own $HOME (see bin/coco / ARG HOME above),
# not /home/coco: at runtime the container is run with -e HOME=<host $HOME>
# so that agent configs cached with absolute host paths (e.g. claude's
# plugin marketplace install locations) stay valid. building the coco
# native binary (below) under that same path keeps `claude install` from
# needing to run again at every container start.
#
# -M (no skel copy), not -m: /etc/skel's ~/.bash_profile -> ~/.bashrc ->
# /etc/bashrc chain would run after /etc/profile.d/coco-bashrc.sh on
# login shells and clobber its PS1 with the stock [user@host dir]$ one.
#
# no chown to ${UID} and no `USER coco` anywhere at build time: under
# rootless podman the build runs in a user namespace that maps only the
# host user's own UID plus its /etc/subuid range (65536 ids by default),
# so a large UID (e.g. 577997 on LDAP/NFS sites) is unmapped there and
# chown/setuid to it fail with EINVAL. useradd itself copes (only warns).
# ownership is fixed up at container start instead (entrypoint.sh), where
# --userns=keep-id makes the UID resolvable.
